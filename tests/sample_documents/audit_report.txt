Internal Audit Report: APAC Trade Reconciliation System
Report ID: IA-2025-Q3-042
Date: October 15, 2025
Classification: Confidential

Executive Summary:
The Q3 2025 audit of the APAC trade reconciliation system identified
three critical findings and five moderate findings. The system processes
approximately 15,000 trades per day across five offices (Hong Kong,
Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney, and Mumbai).

Critical Finding 1: Timestamp Synchronization
The Hong Kong and Singapore offices use different timezone handling
methods, resulting in a 2.3% mismatch rate in daily reconciliations.
This affects approximately 345 trades per day. The root cause is a
legacy timezone library (pytz 2019.3) used by the Singapore system
while Hong Kong uses the updated version (pytz 2025.1).

Critical Finding 2: Missing Validation Rules
The automated validation engine lacks 12 of the 47 required HKMA
validation rules. These rules were updated in the July 2025
regulatory circular but were not implemented in the system.

Critical Finding 3: Insufficient Access Controls
Three former employees retained active system access for an average
of 47 days after their departure date. The maximum observed retention
was 83 days for a Singapore-based employee who left on July 1, 2025.

Recommendations:
1. Standardize timezone libraries across all APAC offices by Dec 2025
2. Implement the 12 missing HKMA validation rules by January 2026
3. Automate access revocation to trigger within 24 hours of departure
4. Conduct monthly access review audits
5. Deploy real-time reconciliation monitoring dashboard

Timeline: All critical findings must be remediated by March 31, 2026
to meet the HKMA regulatory deadline.
